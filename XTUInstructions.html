    <h2>About Intel XTU</h2>
    <p>Intel XTU is software that you can use to alter the performance of your <strong>Intel</strong>
      cpu by either undervolting or overclocking. XTU is also capable of alterting your integrated graphics
      voltages but I recomend not to do that. Also note that only K and X series processors from Intel are
      officially unlocked and can be overclocked, every other processor can only be undervolted.
    </p>

    <br>
    <h2>Why you should undervolt your cpu</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>It reduces temperature of cpu</li>
      <li>Less fan noise</li>
      <li>Increase battery life</li>
      <li>Improves performance</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Undervolting Guide</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><p>The first thing you should do is go download the software <a href="https://downloadcenter.intel.com/download/24075/Intel-Extreme-Tuning-Utility-Intel-XTU-?product=66427" target=_blank >
        here.</a><br>Click the blue <em>"XTUSetup.exe"</em> button</p></li>

      <li><p>Now run the installation, your computer will require a restart.You will be shown a welcome screen
        showing details of your current machine, including cpu specs, memory species
        and any graphic cards installed. On the bottom you can see the current status of your cpu, temperature ,
        utilization etc.I am currently using a Dell XPS 15(9560) for this example </p></li>
        <img src="https://image.ibb.co/eAH42p/1st.png">
     <li><p>Next thing you want to do is click on the core button on the left, this will cause a window to pop up stating the warnings of altering cpu
     voltages. Do not worry we will only be undervolting and the worst that can happen is BSOD(blue screen of death).
     Undervolting will not damage any hardware</p></li>
       <img src="https://image.ibb.co/b8OQsp/Iagree.png">
     <li><p>After locate the core voltage offset bar, yours should have 0.000 set.In my example my voltage
       is already set to an offset of -0.105v. Every cpu is different so you must keep doing trials to gauge
        the stability. For example the i7-7700hq in my alienware 15r3 has a offset of -0.125v even though it has
        the exact same cpu.</p></li>
